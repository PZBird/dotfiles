# Dot files
## For zsh and vim config

Scripts for create and init zsh and vim configs for clean setup

For init
```
sh ./init.sh
```

For restoring config if it exist before running init script

```
sh ./restore.sh
```

### NOTES
This is my personal config for comfort work
- zsh hash autocomplite for `git, pm2, docker, docker-compose, brew, macos, virtualenv, node, yarn, npm, kubectl`
- vim has support for `javascript`, `typescript`, contain `NerdTREE`, `fzf` and `tsserver`
